## Introduction

This project is the official implementation of our [Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention]().
The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to obtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade and even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a novel **IR-QLoRA** for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate through information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two technologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1) statistics-based *Information Calibration Quantization* allows the quantized parameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2) finetuning-based *Information Elastic Connection* makes LoRA utilizes elastic representation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive experiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA and LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, *e.g.*, 4-bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4% improvement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant performance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption, revealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that IR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks (*e.g.*, NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.

## Getting Started

This tutorial uses the Alpaca dataset as an example to perform IR-QLoRA fine-tuning on the LLaMA-7B model in PyTorch.

### Fine-tune
The `irqlora.py` code is a starting point for finetuning and inference on various datasets. Basic command for finetuning a baseline model on the Alpaca dataset:

```bash
python irqlora.py --model_name_or_path <path_or_name>
```

We provide a script in `scripts/finetune.sh` file for fine-tuning on alpaca, and you are free to adjust its parameters to get the results you want.

### Evaluation

To evaluate the fine-tuned model, you can use the `evaluate_mmlu.py` script. Basic command for evaluating a fine-tuned model on the MMLU dataset:

```bash
python evaluate_mmlu.py --model_name_or_path <path_or_name> --lora_ckpt_dir <lora_checkpoint_dir>
```

We provide a script in `scripts/evaluate_mmlu.sh` file for evaluating on mmlu (5-shot).
